`sandbox.thread` decides each thread's whole sandbox (workspace, image and policy) once, at the thread's first admission. The image goes through the new optional `ManagedWorkspaceProvider.resolveImageEnvironment`, and its identity is recorded in the thread's creation intent; the image reference and the policy overrides are recorded beside the association in the same transaction, and every reconnect runs the thread's recorded policy over the app's. `dockerSandbox({ images })` bounds which images a thread may name and refuses anything else before any Docker call; `image` is optional when `images` is given. A thread may not open a network the app denies, and `security` stays per app. `b4 check`, `b4 build` and startup refuse unknown `sandbox` keys and `thread` beside `workspace`; a thread-sandbox app builds to a `{ version: 2, kind: "thread" }` artifact. The installation now stores a workspace's source only after its environment resolves, so a refused image leaves no source behind.

**Behaviour change:** `b4 check`, `b4 build` and startup now refuse any key in the `sandbox` block other than `workspace`, `thread`, `provider`, `network`, `env`, `resources`, `security` and `idleTimeoutMs`. A misspelt key used to be ignored silently, which left every thread in a per-app sandbox; rename or remove any other key.
