Client-provided tools over AG-UI (cacheplane/b4run#743). On a route named in `server.agui.clientTools`, the model can now call the tools an AG-UI client defines (CopilotKit's `useFrontendTool`, for example). Before, the opt-in only made the `tools` field accepted.

Each client tool becomes a tool the model sees as `client_<name>`. When the model calls one, the server records the call and parks the turn. The client sees the tool-call frames under its own name and an ordinary `RUN_FINISHED`, runs the tool, and sends `{ role: "tool", toolCallId, content }` on its next run. The server matches that result against its record of calls it issued, on this thread and route, still outstanding and unexpired, and resumes the turn. Resent history is ignored, and each result is used once. A new user message, or a call older than `server.agui.clientToolTtlMs` (default 10 minutes), abandons the unanswered call: it is closed with "The client did not return a result for this tool call." and the new message runs.

- Definitions are bounded (32 tools, 1,024-character descriptions, 8,192-character and 8-level `parameters`, 32,768 characters in total across names, descriptions and serialized `parameters`) and refused with a `422` otherwise. Each result is capped at 64 KiB of UTF-8 (`413 client_tool_result_too_large` when a run answers with a larger one; a larger one resent in history is dropped and the call is abandoned). The bounds cap context budget; they do not prevent prompt injection.
- A new reserved `clientTool` permission key gates client tool calls: exact match, allowed by default, `deny` refuses, never inherits a `tool:<name>` entry, and never offers `always`.
- New `ClientToolCallStore` with an in-memory store (`@b4run/sdk`), a SQLite store (`@b4run/sqlite-storage`, the node default at `.b4/client-tool-calls.sqlite`) and a Postgres store (`createPostgresClientToolCallStore` in `@b4run/postgres-storage`). Set `server.agui.clientToolStore` on edge or serverless targets and on multi-instance deployments; with no store, client tool runs are refused with `503 client_tool_store_unavailable`.

Behavior changes:

- Tool names starting with `client_` are now reserved. A route with an authored or capability tool named `client_*` fails preparation, and `b4 check` reports an authored one.
- `POST /agui/:routeId` request bodies are capped at 8 MiB (`413 payload_too_large`) on every route. Long histories with many inline images can reach it.
- On AG-UI, a request whose last message is a `role: "tool"` message now counts as `resuming: true` for thread-access policies, on every route.
- `POST /threads/:thread_id/resume`, `POST /threads/:thread_id/runs/stream` and `POST /threads/:thread_id/runs/wait` refuse with `409 client_tool_pending` while a client tool call is parked on the thread; the call is answered or abandoned through the AG-UI endpoint. A new Agent Protocol run there would drop the park and leave the model's tool call with no result.
- On AG-UI, a request whose last message is a `role: "tool"` message now takes the thread's resume claim on every route, so a concurrent request on the same thread may get `409 resume_in_progress`.
- On an opted-in route, a trailing `role: "tool"` message that answers nothing is now a no-op (an empty `RUN_STARTED` / `RUN_FINISHED`) instead of re-running the newest user message.
- AG-UI turns now void superseded approval grants when they settle, as the Agent Protocol run handlers already did.
